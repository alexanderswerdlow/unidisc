See `unidisc/datasets/preprocessing` for instructions on how to preprocess datasets.

We support the following datasets:

- Cambrian

- CC12M
- DataComp1B
- JourneyDB
- LAION400M

Additionally, we generated our own synthetic dataset and provide the [generation scripts](unidisc/datasets/preprocessing/unidisc_dataset/README.md) as well as the raw data.
